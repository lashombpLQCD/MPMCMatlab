A MATLAB implementation of our [Multipolynomial Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09559.pdf) method.

There are multiple versions of the program, each of which implements different stages of development for the program. 

The main program containing all improvements and forms of deflation is provided in the file, `Full Version/QCDTRACEMultiPolysDefl.m`.
